            All About Us will bring 25,000 secondary school students to a three day event in Dublin come Autumn 2016; however, bringing students to the event does not even come close to describing what our real aim is; we want our young attendees to have their most memorable school outing ever, a day that could very well pave the way for a happy and successful future, a day that opens them up to a world of possibilities, a day where they can engage and interact with incredible speakers, industry professionals, college representatives, guidance counselors and fellow students from around the country in truly unique ways. </p>

              The event has been developed because we see a major opportunity for a new and exciting event for students, one that caters for all students irrespective of their academic ability or  socioeconomic background. We also know that young people are faced with numerous pressures and the information and guidance that they need to help overcome various challenges isn't always available to them, we want this to change. At present there is no national youth conference in Ireland, because of this we want to host an annual event which will have a positive impact on many young lives for many years to come.

We want “the chosen one”  to be the type of person who we will be proud to represent us, but more importantly to be a fantastic role model for any teenager in Ireland;  having an ambassador who can relate to our target audience of mature teens is essential. The right guy or gal will not only help promote our initiative but will as act as MC at “All About Us” in Autumn 2016, an exciting opportunity for the right candidate. We have a few names in mind, so we will keep you posted!

						<h3>Inspiration</h3>
						<p>
						 	All About Us is going to bring some of truly inspirational people to Dublin come autumn 2016. Our speakers will have overcome some incredible challenges and will have incredible stories to share. These motivational speakers will aim to inspire students to stay in school, say no to drugs, become leaders, and prepare for life after graduation.

					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Bullying/Cyberbullying:</h3>
						<p>
						 	Bullying can be common in the workplace, schools, college settings and even at home, it is a very serious problem and for the individual on the receiving end of bullying it can be extremely damaging; as a result it is a behavioural problem that we want to talk about. Our speakers on this topic will give their personal experience on the subject, they will discuss the harm it caused them and how it affected their lives.

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Mental Health</h3>
						<p>
						 	According to recent research recent one in five young Irish adults aged 19-24 and one in 6 young people aged 11-13 are currently experiencing mental health problems, that’s a lot. Experiencing mental ill-health in early life places young people at increased risk of further episodes of mental ill-health during their adult years. With this information in mind, we want to talk about mental health because talking raises awareness, reduces the stigma, it helps us to understand the link between suicide and mental health, and it can help us to understand that a person is not defined by their mental health issue. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Sexuality</h3>
						<p>
						 	Young people are sexual beings, even if they are not sexually active. Sexuality is about a lot more than having sex, it is concerned with the young person’s growing awareness, experience,  intimacy, sexual orientation and gender identity, it is no doubt a worthwhile topic at a young person’s convention. Talking about sex is important as it can help us to develop healthy attitudes toward sex and to learn responsible sexual behavior.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Drugs, Alcohol, and Addiction</h3>
						<p>
						 	Dependence, also known as addiction, refers to more long-term use of alcohol and drugs. The person may use greater amounts of the drug as they can tolerate larger amounts. They can also experience serious withdrawal symptoms if they cannot get the drugs or alcohol their body and mind craves. When a person is addicted, life becomes more centred on using the drug or drinking. They are no longer in control of their use and can find it difficult to stop despite the fact that it is causing harm. With addiction, there is a physical or psychological dependence on the substance. Addiction is considered by some to be a chronic, progressive illness. 
					 	</p>
					 	<p>
							Most teens will come into contact with drugs and alcohol in some form or another at some point in their lives.  Many decide not to take them, but some do. The reasons for usage  might be a case of rebellion, or a need to fit in; others might use them as a way to relax, get high, and lose inhibitions;  or it could even be as simple as curiosity. Whatever the reasons, we at All About Us want to talk about it and our speakers will share their experience on the subject
						</p>
					</div>				
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Healthy Eating</h3>
						<p>
						 	What is healthy eating? Well, it involves consuming a wide variety of foods in the correct portion sizes in line with food pyramid recommendations. A healthy, balanced diet is essential for overall good health, consistent energy levels, positive mood, and reduces the risk of diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Irish people are not eating enough healthy fruit and vegetables and are consuming  foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Combined with low levels of physical activity, this can cause an increase in levels of overweight and obesity, which can in turn lead to development of diabetes and early signs of heart disease.  We want to  educate young people on how to eat healthily and the additional  benefits that occur from eating well. 

						</p>
					</div>				
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Equality and Diversity in Ireland</h3>
						<p>
						 	Equality is ensuring individuals or groups of individuals are treated fairly and equally and no less favourably. Areas where equality is an issue tend to include race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, and age. By  promoting equality we aim to remove as much discrimination as possible. Our speakers will address these issues and will delve into their personal lives to discuss their experience of issues around equality and what’s it like to be “different” in Ireland.
						</p>
					</div>				
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Social Media</h3>
						<p>
						 	The internet and social media provide young people with a range of benefits, and opportunities to empower themselves in a variety of ways. Young people can maintain social connections and support networks that otherwise wouldn't be possible, and can access more information than ever before. The communities and social interactions young people form online can be invaluable for improving and developing young person’s  self-confidence and social skills. We want discuss how social media can be used to benefit young people but we also want to discuss whether or not there is a darker side to social media and if so what can we do about it. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>One World</h3>
						<p>
						 	Young people make up 40% of Ireland’s population making us one of the youngest countries in the European Union .According to the UN, 2.8 billion people across the developing world are under the age of 24. In the Middle East and North Africa, it’s estimated that over 65% of the population are under 30.We are the youth generation! Young people and students need to be at the forefront of campaigning. Without us, the battle for human rights around the world cannot work. Dictators will continue to oppress people; torturers will continue to torture; prisoners of conscience will remain in prison. At “All About Us” we will have speakers who will be commenting on some of the most topical issues the world is facing in the hope of motivating young people to get involved in the various different types of human rights organisations and local charities which teenagers can work with. 
						</p>
					</div>	
					<div class="topic">
						<h3>Sports</h3>
						<p>
						 	If young people are to stay involved in sport throughout their adult life, they need to be equipped with the fundamentals to remain involved with sport and physical activity. Equally we need to ensure that their early experiences are positive and enjoyable, irrespective of their ability, gender, social class, race, etc.  Our speakers at All About Us will act as role models for young people in sport, will encourage young people to get involved and will discuss how sport

						<h3>The Media Room</h3>
						<p>
						 	 All About Us will be inviting students to participate in youth focused media workshops over several weekends prior to the event. Joining the workshops are professionals in the media field that participate as a source of inspiration and experience for the participants. They will be guiding and supporting the group in creating professional results. With their professional perspective and experience, the media experts direct the media production process and help participants with their planning and conclusion of the media outcome. Why? Because we want these students to produce content as the event unfolds,  the media room will be used as a space to do this during the event. More importantly and a lot more exciting is our aim to broadcast live from the The Media Room from our unique station “All About Us FM.  With the help of some recognisable voices the participants of the workshops will help present and produce the various shows will have lined up for the three days of the event,  pretty cool right?
